            <h2>The Story Behind Space Explorer</h2>
            <p>The idea for <strong>Space Explorer</strong> was born during a late-night coding session, where Alex's endless space facts met Jordan's desire to create something meaningful.</p>
            <p><strong>Alex</strong> wanted to share the awe of the cosmos in a way that didn't feel overwhelmingâ€”<strong>no complex terms, just pure fascination</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Jordan</strong> saw an opportunity to blend <strong>clean design, smooth interactivity, and educational value</strong> into one project.</p>
            <p>And so, <strong>Space Explorer</strong> was launchedâ€”a platform where anyone can explore the universe, one captivating image at a time.</p>
